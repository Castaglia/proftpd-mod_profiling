Configuration

  ProfileEngine on|off
    If configured to 'off', AND PR_DEVEL_PROFILE is defined, then use
    moncontrol(2) to disable profiling at module init time.

    If PR_DEVEL_PROFILE is defined, then ProfileEngine defaults to 'on'.

  ProfilePath path
    Configure the directory that will contain the generated gmon.out files.

    For example:

      ProfilePath /path/to/prof

    Then a profiled proftpd process will generate /path/to/prof/<PID>/,
    and store its gmon.out file in the <PID> directory.

Implementation

On module init, create the ProfilePath directory for the main/daemon process
and chdir() into it.  This will be used e.g. when compiled with
--enable-devel=nofork, or when forking.

On session init, create the ProfilePath directory for the session process,
and chdir() into it.  Note that chroot(2) will affect this; it means that
the session process' gmon.out file won't appear in the ProfilePath directory.
(And we don't have a chance to copy/move the generated gmon.out file; would
using atexit(2) work?)

Thus we need a module-specific configure script, to detect the presence/support
of moncontrol(2).
