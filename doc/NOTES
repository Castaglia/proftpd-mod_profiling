Configuration

  ProfileEngine on|off
    If configured to 'off', AND PR_DEVEL_PROFILE is defined, then use
    moncontrol(2) to disable profiling at module init time.

    If PR_DEVEL_PROFILE is defined, then ProfileEngine defaults to 'on'.

  ProfilePath path
    Configure the directory that will contain the generated gmon.out files.

    For example:

      ProfilePath /path/to/prof

    Then a profiled proftpd process will generate /path/to/prof/<PID>/,
    and store its gmon.out file in the <PID> directory.

Implementation

On module init, create the ProfilePath directory for the main/daemon process;
chdir() into it in a 'core.shutdown' listener.  This will be used e.g. when
compiled with --enable-devel=nofork, or when forking.

On session init, create the ProfilePath directory for the session process;
chdir() into it in a 'core.exit' listener.  Note that chroot(2) will affect
this; it means that the session process' gmon.out file won't appear in the
ProfilePath directory.

And we don't have a chance to copy/move the generated gmon.out file; would
using atexit(2) work?  Or perhaps using fchdir(2), and opening the ProfilePath
process directory to get the dirfd, prior to chroot()?

Thus we need a module-specific configure script, to detect the presence/support
of moncontrol(2).
